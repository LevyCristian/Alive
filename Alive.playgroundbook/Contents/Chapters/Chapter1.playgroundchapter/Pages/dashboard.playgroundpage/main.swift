Uhuru üéâ,  you learned what is Parallax Art and how to create it, but this is not the end! Would you like to create your first Parallax art with a little help? That's right, on this page you will create your first Parallax art with a little help from an Artboard üëè. Stay tuned for the following steps:
 
 1. When you click on run my code a button will appear on the upper left side of the screen with the name `Layers` in which you will choose the layer you want to change - Back, Middle, or Front.
 2. After selecting the layer, on the upper right side, there will be 2 buttons called `Draw` for drawing and `Galery` for choosing some standard arts that you can use in each layer.
 3. The draw button activates your ‚úèÔ∏è Apple Pencil, but you can also draw with your finger if you want.
 4. We suggest that you use the art in the gallery because it looks very beautiful and it will be easier.
 5. After choosing all the layers, click on the button on the right side called apply effect to see the effect on your art.
 6. Just click the stop button when you have done everything because it will trim all your progress ü§ß.

Are you ready? Click in `run my code` and go for it!
 
That's is all folks! I hope you enjoyed the experience and learned a little more about art! Now, if you want to know a little more about me, let's go to the [next page!](@next)
